Tsugi-util contains a set of utility classes to aid  in the development
of BasicLTI consumers and providers. They deal with much of the heavy lifting
and make the process more opaque to the developer.

This code originated in the Sakai project as "basiclti-util" - it was always
designed to be "Sakai-free" and many Java projects used that Sakai artifact.
As of May, 2017 - this is pulled into the Tsugi project for future maintenance
and development as it is really the "level-1" of the Tsugi Java 
application stack.

This new independent repo for this artifact makes much more sense for non-Sakai Java projects.
This also allows a simpler way to contribute new code and bug fixes to this
library.

Compiling a Local Copy
----------------------

There are 'deploy to SonaType' instructions below.  But if you want to compile and 
develop locally, use this command:

    mvn clean compile install


Running Unit Tests
------------------

Use the command 

    mvn test

Bringing in Changes from Sakai
------------------------------

This code also lives (for now) in the Sakai.  To compare the trees,
run:

    bash compare.sh

It will issue some cp commands to bring the two trees up to date.  Alternatively
you can just delete the contents of the `src` folder here and 
copy the contents of the `basiclti-tsugi/src/` folder into this folder and
let `git` figure out what changed.

Using tsugi-util in your application
------------------------------------

You can add the following to your pom.xml:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>org.tsugi</groupId>
        <artifactId>tsugi-java</artifactId>
        <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

    <dependency>
       <groupId>org.tsugi</groupId>
       <artifactId>tsugi-util</artifactId>
       <version>0.3-SNAPSHOT</version>
    </dependency>

If you need to enable snapshot downloading add the following to your
pom.xml:

    <repositories>
        <repository>
            <id>sonatype-nexus-snapshots</id>
            <name>Sonatype Nexus Snapshots</name>
            <url> https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots </url>
            <releases>
                <enabled>false</enabled>
            </releases>
            <snapshots>
                <enabled>true</enabled>
            </snapshots>
        </repository>
    </repositories>

This way when maven sees a SNAPSHOT version, it can find where to download it from.

You can see this all in action in the Tsugi Java Servlet:

    https://github.com/tsugiproject/tsugi-java-servlet

Generating a local copy of the javadocs
---------------------------------------

If you want to work on or view the java docs, use the following commands:

    mvn javadoc:javadoc
    open apidocs/index.html

Releasing tsugi-util to Sonatype
--------------------------------

Here is a sample `~/.m2/settings.xml`:

    <settings>
      <servers>
        <server>
          <id>ossrh</id>
          <username>drchuck</username>
          <password>?secret!</password>
        </server>
      </servers>
    <profiles>
      <profile>
         <id>allow-snapshots</id>
            <activation><activeByDefault>true</activeByDefault></activation>
         <repositories>
           <repository>
             <id>snapshots-repo</id>
             <url>https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots</url>
             <releases><enabled>false</enabled></releases>
             <snapshots><enabled>true</enabled></snapshots>
           </repository>
         </repositories>
       </profile>
    </profiles>
    </settings>

Once you have settings set up, 

    mvn -DperformRelease=true clean javadoc:jar compile install deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=Whatever
    mvf clean #afterwards

Check results of the deploy at:

    https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~tsugi-util

After a while the files migrate to:

    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/tsugi/

Doing A Numbered Release
------------------------

    git checkout -b 0.3.x
    change pom.xml version 0.3.1
    mvn clean javadoc:jar compile install deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=Whatever
    git commmit -a
    git push origin 0.3.x

    git checkout master
    change pom.xml version 0.4-SNAPSHOT
    mvn clean javadoc:jar compile install deploy -Dgpg.passphrase=Whatever
    git commmit -a
    git push

Check results of the deploy at:

    https://oss.sonatype.org/#nexus-search;quick~tsugi-util

After a while the files migrate to:

    https://oss.sonatype.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/tsugi/

    We need to generate a lot of random bytes. It is a good idea to perform
    some other action (type on the keyboard, move the mouse, utilize the
    disks) during the prime generation; this gives the random number
    generator a better chance to gain enough entropy.
